# pampa

**Pampa** is a Ruby library for distributing computing providing the following features:

* cluster-management with dynamic reconfiguration (joining and leaving nodes);
* distribution of the computation jobs to the (active) nodes; 
* error handling, job-retry and fault tolerance;
* fast (non-direct) communication to ensure realtime capabilities.

The **Pampa** fremwork is widely used for:

* large scale web scraping with what we call a "bot-farm", 
* payments processing, 
* downloading and processing bounce reports to our email marketing service, 
* generating and publishing reports to our users
